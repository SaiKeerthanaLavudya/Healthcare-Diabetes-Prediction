# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
A machine learning project to predict diabetes using the Pima Indian dataset, with Streamlit app for interactive use.

📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify whether a patient is likely to be diabetic based on diagnostic measurements. It demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline from data preparation to deployment.

Key components:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Machine learning model development (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Streamlit-based prediction web app.

🧬 Dataset

- Source: Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset – Kaggle
- Features: Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc.
- Target: Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/SaiKeerthanaLavudya/Healthcare-Diabetes-Prediction.git
cd Healthcare-Diabetes-Prediction

2. Install Required Packages

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run app.py

📒 Notebook Highlights

The diabetes_analysis.ipynb notebook includes:
- Data exploration with charts and statistics
- Cleaning and feature scaling
- Model training and comparison
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

🌐 Deployment

This application can be deployed on Streamlit Cloud for public access.
